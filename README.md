## Message From Lou
This application simulates an Amazon-style storefront, allowing users to browse available products and make selections. Once a user chooses a product, the system prompts them with a series of questions to refine their selection, then calculates the total cost based on their choices.The backend is powered by MySQL, which handles data storage and retrieval, while Node.js processes user interactions and manages transactions.

Technologies Used:
Node.js
JavaScript
MySQL
JSON


### MySQL
The JavaScript files mentioned above query a MySQL database called `Bamazon` which is locally hosted on my laptop.

The mysql is built of a sqhema file. Please refer to the `schema.sql` file to see how the database was created using raw SQL queries.
