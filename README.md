### Overview
I created a simple application that works and operates like an amazon store front. the point of the application is to allow users to go into the store and allow them to make selections based on the products that are listed and available.

the application ises mysql and databases on the back end to store and retrieve data. Once the user makes a selection the node.js progam will start to ask a series of questions for the usere allow them to select a product and the program will then calculate their total. 


Technology Used:

Node.js
javasctipt 
Mysql
Json

- `BamazonCustomer.js`

### MySQL
The JavaScript files mentioned above query a MySQL database called `Bamazon` which is locally hosted on my laptop.

The mysql is built of a sqhema file. Please refer to the `schema.sql` file to see how the database was created using raw SQL queries.
